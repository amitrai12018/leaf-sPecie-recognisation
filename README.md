THIS PROJECT IS A PART OF KRITI INTER HOSTEL TECH COMPETITION AMONG 12 HOSTELS OF IIT GUWAHATI.



ML_HACKATHON FILE CONTAINS THE PROBLEM STATEMENT.
XCEPTION_123.IPYNB CONTAINS THE PYTHON CODE I WROTE FOR PROJECT.
ITS EXECUTED RESULTS ARE SHOWN IN  __results__.html( DOWNLOADED FROM MY KAGGLE ACCOUNT)
The provided dataset (dataset.tar.gz file)DOWNLOAD DATASET FROM(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SKzdTgInW7VUQuuFkjhCKjfOesRIcRbo/view?usp=sharing)consists of 24694 train images
and 3090 test(public) images and both have 185 classes. All images are
of the size 224x224 pixels with 3 color channels

we have used XCEPTION model from sctarch using cnn in keras for model implementation .
.THE END RESULUTS CAN BE SEEN IN FILE __results__.html.THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED WITH TRAINING SET ACCIURACY OF 97.96% AND VALIDATION SET ACCURACY 95.25 % (SEE LAST CELL OUTPUT IN __results__.html FILE). ALSO MODEL.h5 file conatins link for  trained wieghts that we obtained after trainig the model.
ALSO THE ACCURACY OF PRIVATE DATASET CAME OUT TO BE APPROX 90%( NOT SHOWN HERE)


NOTE: WE HAD DONE OUR PROJECT IN KAGGLE FOR HIGHER GPU POWER , SO WE UPLOADED THE DATA SET IN KGGLE INPUT FORM THE LINK https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SKzdTgInW7VUQuuFkjhCKjfOesRIcRbo/view?usp=sharing
